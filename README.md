## Analysis Background
The world of programming with `Python`. 
In these Analysis, have used the concepts i have learned to complete `two` Python challenges, 
`PyBank` and `PyPoll`. Both tasks present a real-world situation where newly developed `Python scripting` skills come in handy.

## PyBank Instructions

In this Analysis, created a `Python` script to analyze the _financial records_ of `Banking` company. 
`Financial dataset` was given called `budget_data.csv`. The dataset Was composed of two columns: `"Date"` and `"Profit/Losses"`.

### Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset,  The net `total` amount of "`Profit/Losses`" over the entire period,  The changes in "`Profit/Losses`" over the entire period, and then the `average` of those changes,  The greatest `increase` in profits (date and amount) over the entire period,  The `greatest decrease` in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### In addition, final script has both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results at Analysis folder.

In this Analysis, with helping a small, rural _town modernize_ its vote-counting process, a set of poll data was given called `election_data.csv`. 
The dataset was composed of three columns: "`Voter ID`", "`County`", and "`Candidate`". 
My task was to create a `Python` script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

- The total number of `votes` cast   
- A complete list of **candidates** who received votes   
- The `percentage` of votes each candidate won   
- The total number of `votes` each candidate won   
- The `winner` of the `election` based on popular vote. 

In addition, final script has both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results at Analysis folder.

## Lesson learned 
### Considering what i have learned so far. 
- [x] how to import modules like csv.   
- [x] have learned how to read and write files in various formats.      
- [x] how to store content in variables lists, and dictionaries.   
- [x] learned how to iterate through basic data structures.   
- [x] learned how to debug along the way. Using all that i have learned, try to break down my tasks into discrete mini-objectives.   

The datasets for these Challenges were quite large. This was done purposefully to showcase one of the limits of Excel-based analysis. 
#
#
> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.
#
# In conclusion, As a data analysts; our first instinct is often to go straight to Excel, but creating scripts in Python can provide us with more powerful options for handling big data.

#
# Repo Instructions
- Inside my local `Git` repository, created a folder for each Analysis by `Python` and name them `PyBank` and `PyPoll`.  

### In each folder, have created, added the following content:  
- A new file called `main.py`. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.  
- A `Resources` folder that contains the `CSV` files i have used. Assured that my `script` has the correct path to the `CSV` file.  
- An `analysis` folder that contains text file that has the results from each analysis.  
- Pushed these changes to `GitHub` profile by `bash terminal.`
